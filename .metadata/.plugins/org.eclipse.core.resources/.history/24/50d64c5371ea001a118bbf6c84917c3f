		 * System.out.printf --(f means "formatted") displays formatted data.
		 * fixed text is output by printf just as it would be by print or println
		 * format specifiers each of it is a "placeholder" for a value and specifies the type of data to output
		 * format specifiers begin with a percent sign (%) followed by a character that representeds the data type
		 * %s is a placeholder for a string
		 * %n is a newline
