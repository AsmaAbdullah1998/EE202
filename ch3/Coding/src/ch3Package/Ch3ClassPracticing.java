//Intro to Classes, Object, Methods and Strings
//This chapter depends on the terminology and concepts of object-oriented programming
/*
 * Predefined:
 * System.out--object
 * print--method
 * Scanner--class
 */
// in this chapter you will learn how to create your own classes and methods
//each new class you create becomes a new "type" that can be used to declare variables and create objects
package ch3Package;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Ch3ClassPracticing {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		/*
		 * Explain the different between next and nextLine methods in Scanner!
		 */
//		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
//		System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
//		String name = input.next(); //"next" reads he next word! 
//		System.out.println(name);// the result wiil be the first word any word after the space will not be included
//		
//		String name = input.nextLine(); //Pressing enter inserts a new line character after characters you typed
//		//Scanner provides various other input methods
